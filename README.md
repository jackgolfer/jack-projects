### **This is a collection of various different files that demonstrate diffent programs written by me, Jack.**

[bash_shell_simulator.cpp](https://github.com/jackgolfer/jack_projects/blob/main/bash_shell_simulator.cpp) - this program simulates the running of a bash shell on a Unix machine. It uses system calls as well as process creation and manipulation to achive this.

[caching_simulator.cpp](https://github.com/jackgolfer/jack_projects/blob/main/caching_simulator.cpp) - this program simluates a hardware level cache with multiple tiers as well as different caching policies. 

[elevator_kernel_module.c](https://github.com/jackgolfer/jack_projects/blob/main/elevator_kernel_module.c) - this program is a kernel module for a Linux kernel. It calls custom system calls to run a simulated elevator that picks up and drops people off at their desired floor.

[fat32_file_system.c](https://github.com/jackgolfer/jack_projects/blob/main/fat32_file_system.c) - this program simulates a FAT32 file system. It does that by addressing the indiviual bytes of a file image and adjusting it to match that of the files being entered or manipulated.

[linked_list.hpp](https://github.com/jackgolfer/jack_projects/blob/main/linked_list.hpp) - this program is a Linked List class written from scratch in c++

[spotify_API_program.py](https://github.com/jackgolfer/jack_projects/blob/main/spotify_API_program.py) - this program is a snippet of the code from my song information website, [Jingle Website](https://jingle.herokuapp.com/), this file is in charge of calling the spotity API and retrieving the desired infomation, and passing it back to the Django framework of the rest of the program.

[word_counter.cpp](https://github.com/jackgolfer/jack_projects/blob/main/word_counter.cpp) - this program simply counts the number of unique words, letters, and characters in a input, and shows the top 10 most used. Although simple, this program is mainly to demostrate the use of particule containers to make an extremely efficient program. For example, a input of 42,000 lines takes .5 seconds to analyze.
